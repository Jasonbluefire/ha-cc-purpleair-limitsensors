The simplest way to install this integration is with the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS). This is not (yet) part of the default store and will need to be added as a custom repository.

Setting up a custom repository is done by:

1. Go into HACS from the side bar.
2. Click into Integrations.
3. Click the 3-dot menu in the top right and select `Custom repositories`
4. In the UI that opens, copy and paste the [url for this github repo](https://github.com/Jasonbluefire/ha-cc-purpleair_lite) into the `Add custom repository URL` field.
5. Set the category to `Integration`.
6. Click the `Add` button.
7. Select PurpleAir Lite from the list and press the download button. 
8. Further configuration is done within the Integrations configuration in Home Assistant. You may need to restart home assistant and clear your browser cache before it appears, try ctrl+shift+r if you don't see it in the configuration list.
